                Why should you care about Cybersecurity?</p>

            <p>Computers are all around us. Our laptops and phones may be obvious, but computers are now in everything
                from doorbells to lightbulbs. Computers, like all systems, have vulnerabilities which can be exploited.
                When a vulnerability is subjected to the right condition, it becomes a threat. When that threat is acted
                upon, it becomes an incident.</p>

            <p>Cybersecurity is about understanding those vulnerabilities, threats, and incidents. What tools are
                available to protect yourself, your devices, and your privacy?</p>

            <p>Jobs are currently in demand and are expected to grow
                Information Security Analysts can expect to earn more than programmers
                You, or someone you know may be affected by cybercrime.</p>
