<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
    My research examines how data-intensive information systems can both help and harm different communities and groups; and how educational interventions (at many different scales) can help to create a more just and equitable computer-mediated society. 
    At the undergraduate level, I develop and study ways of expanding engineering education to include social and ethical considerations. 
    Outside of the university, I work with youth and community organizations to help them learn about data and computation â€“ for use in advocacy campaigns (e.g., access to clean air, clean water, safe neighborhoods, and vibrant public amenities) and for economic empowerment (e.g., job training programs).
</p>
<p>
    Before coming to UNCA, I was an Assistant Professor of Instruction in the Department of Computer Science at Northwestern University. 
    I received my Ph.D. in Information Science from the UC Berkeley School of Information. 
    Prior to academia, I worked as a software designer/developer, building data and communication systems to support 
    public accountability for city and regional development projects.
