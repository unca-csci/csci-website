<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am fortunate to be a part of this institution that prioritizes academic rigor by helping students to recognize their own value system while respecting the perspectives of others, to develop competencies in one or more disciplines of their choice, to discover significant connections between disciplines, and to determine their own civic contributions to society. As with most of my UNC Asheville colleagues, my commitments to our educational mission and to the computing discipline are motivated by the enthusiasm of our students for learning and by the collegiality of my faculty and staff colleagues.</p>
