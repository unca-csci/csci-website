<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>
    I work at the exciting intersection of computer science and art, 
    developing software and creating tangible forms. The largest and 
    most exciting project I've ever worked on was an extension of 
    Professor Bruce and my Senior Design class in which our students 
    designed an animatronic sculpture under the art direction of Mel 
    Chin. After the semester, the sculpture was fabricated and 
    installed at Times Square. The students were also mentored by 
    Sara Sanders, Linnea Linton, and Brent Skidmore. This year, 
    I'm excited to work with Professors Martin, Sanders, Skidmore, 
    and West to refine our STEAM course offerings; 
    to teach a dual-enrolled class at Cherokee High School using 
    culturally-relevant projects, and to keep making art with 
    Texas A&M's Courtney Starrett.

<p>
    My interests and publications 
    are in 3D computer graphics, tangible computing, and computing 
    in the arts. I thoroughly enjoy the creativity inherent in 
    user-centered design and fabrication, and try to convey that 
    to my students in Computer Science, New Media, and Mechatronics 
    Engineering.

<p>
    Before teaching at UNC Asheville, I worked in industry as a software developer and systems engineer. In addition to corporate work, 
    I developed visualization applications for Duke Cardiology's Electrophysiology Lab.</p>
