        <h1>Who We Are</h1>
        <p>What can you do with a degree in computer science? The question is, what canâ€™t you do? As software engineers,
            visualization researchers, web developers, system administrators, college professors, and FBI agents, our
            alumni
            are shaping the digital landscape across a variety of fields. Our faculty are passionate about breakthrough
            technologies in the areas of artificial intelligence, data science, robotics, scientific modeling, virtual
            reality, and more. Our small classes and our liberal arts focus offer you ample opportunities to work
            alongside
            faculty on research projects and combine your computer science studies with other innovative areas, like
            engineering or new media.

        <h1>What You'll Learn</h1>
        <p>The computer systems concentration prepares students for graduate studies in computer science and for careers
            in
            scientific and engineering applications, systems programming, and software development, while the
            information
            systems concentration prepares students for careers in commercial programming, systems analysis and design,
            and
            database management. Eligible students can receive funding, participate in research and fieldwork, and gain
            teaching experience through our Atmospheric and Computer Science Exploratory Scholars (ACES) Scholarship
            Program. Join us at UNC Asheville to start your career in computer science.
